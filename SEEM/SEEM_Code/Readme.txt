This code is for the SEEM. 

Now you can train a new model by running the script:
python scripts/train.py

You can use the script `scripts/evaluate_model.py` to run any of the models you trained on any of the datsets.

e.g. 
python scripts/evaluate_model.py  --model_path models/sgan-models

Any quenstions, you can e-mail me at dafeng0321@gmail.com
